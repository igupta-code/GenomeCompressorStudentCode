| Nov 13 | 10-10:15 / 6:15-6:45 | I tried to figure out how to run Mr. Blick's tester code using the terminal for so long. And was not super successful :( |
| Nov 14 |        class         |                                    I started coding and finished a draft of compress and expand but haven't tested yet.  |
